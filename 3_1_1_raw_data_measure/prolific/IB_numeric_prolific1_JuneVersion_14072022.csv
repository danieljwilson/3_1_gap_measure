It's a difficult skillset or most people in any industry so that goal is taking a while to actualize. That might have given you more content on my answers for that. Also I accidentally chose very for the first survey questions when I meant to click neutral, hopefully that doesn't disqualify me. I do also think social media was a little vague, I interpreted that as what I do for work, that's a goal I work on being more consistent with for profit with my job so I have to commit time to posting online and gaining an audience. But I think most people would view social media as time on tiktok which could be a waste and major conflict with other goals. Not sure I interpreted that correctly or not but that's why my answers reflected that way for it. I think it's also worth asking if people are neurotypical or not, the gap in my having goals and finishing half or less is related to my adhd. After getting diagnosed, medicated and working in a 10 week skills group I've seen an enormous leap in productivity this last six months. Things just clicked into place where I see prioritizing, procrastination, lack of focus, inability to break things into manageable pieces, perfectionism etc come into play and slowly avoid the same pitfalls that adhd makes me prone to. That's a significant amount of work on my end though so I'm still happy with what I've achieved I'm just aware I'm working at a deficit here. And with volunteering it's around activism in my industry so that's why it's by the wayside currently as covid wiped me out financially and I've been slowly rebuilding my finances since then, that's also why I no longer have an assets at the moment because of the harsh financial setbacks being frequently forced off work for two years. And I guess education always stumps on me this site because it gives the options for high school (or ged) or some college, I didn't graduate high school but I did graduate a culinary arts programs, I also am looking at re-entering school for more programming languages to eventually transition out of my current industry. And some people only have two moms, two dads or non binary parents, so asking about parents education and income with just two genders might be a little exclusionary for some.
